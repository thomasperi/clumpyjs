# Clumpy.js
*Asynchronous Looping in JavaScript*

Clumpy provides a way of modeling [incremental asynchronous processes](http://web.archive.org/web/20190323050823/http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/10/28/) after traditional loops, letting you focus on your program without having to manage the code that chops it up.
