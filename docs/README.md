Clumpy provides a way of modeling [incremental asynchronous processes](https://web.archive.org/web/20190323050823/http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/10/28/) after traditional loops, letting you focus on your program without having to manage the code that chops it up.

I'm in the process of migrating Clumpy from my old web site to github/npm. Until this documentation is complete, you can read the [old documentation](https://www.tumuski.com/code/clumpy/usage/).
