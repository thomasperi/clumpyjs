# Indicating Progress

When a long-running operation is something the user cares about, itâ€™s nice to provide the user with some indication of how close the operation is to completion. To this end, Clumpy lets you specify a function to be called between clumps of execution.

To specify this function, assign it as the `between` property of an object, and pass that object to the `Clumpy` constructor.

```javascript
var clumpy = new Clumpy({
    between: function () {
        console.log('Progress: ' + i);
    }
});

var i;
clumpy.for_loop(
	function () { i = 0; },
	function () { return i < 100000; },
	function () { i += 1; },
	function () {
		// statements
	}
);
```

You can also change the `between` function during the sequence between other chained methods, using the `set` method. Here's an example with consecutive loops using different progress indicators:

```javascript
var clumpy = new Clumpy();

var i;
(clumpy
	.set({
		between: function () {
			console.log('First Loop: ' + i);
		}
	})
	.for_loop(
		function () { i = 0; },
		function () { return i < 100000; },
		function () { i += 1; },
		function () {
			// statements
		}
	)
	.then(function () {
		console.log('First Loop is Finished');
	})
	.set({
		between: function () {
			console.log('Second Loop: ' + i);
		}
	})
	.for_loop(
		function () { i = 0; },
		function () { return i < 100000; },
		function () { i += 1; },
		function () {
			// statements
		}
	)
	.then(function () {
		console.log('Second Loop is Finished');
	})
);
```

It produces something like this:

```
First Loop: 11664
First Loop: 23337
First Loop: 35012
First Loop: 46749
First Loop: 58401
First Loop: 70103
First Loop: 77520
First Loop: 89151
First Loop is Finished
Second Loop: 663
Second Loop: 11528
Second Loop: 22448
Second Loop: 33603
Second Loop: 44707
Second Loop: 55606
Second Loop: 66725
Second Loop: 77791
Second Loop: 88744
Second Loop: 99765
Second Loop is Finished
```

The `set` method behaves like `then`, enqueuing the act of setting `between` until everything before it is complete. It can also accept other options, which are described in the reference.
